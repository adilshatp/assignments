       " '\\n\\n  My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I canâ€™t believe what Iâ€™m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isnâ€™t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and Iâ€™m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I donâ€™t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I canâ€™t believe what Iâ€™m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isnâ€™t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and Iâ€™m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I donâ€™t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.\\n\\n',\n",

Because I donâ€™t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.\\n\\n',\n",

happy customer till now in a world where we talk about openness and open for integration apple gives you a kind of black box boo to apple my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object i have been using android phones since the last years and finally decided to switch to iphone i used to roast iphone for its prices lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc but my last android phone iqoo legend had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android tired of bugs and software glitches in android i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it iphone is so smooth that even my iqoo legend with hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only hz and i can t believe what i m seeing all the games apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy w separate fast charger for rs but charging speed isn t disappointing display quality is truly flagship level and i m quite a fan of the small display believe it or not being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful build quality is great i would recommend not to waste extra k for buying pro because i don t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending k you can see in the rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone wide angle camera struggles in low light but main camera is really good captures true colours front camera is really good too truly flagship speakers are great battery life is better than my previous devices ios is very optimised in terms of battery life easy hrs sot on normal usage note while playing bgmi you loose around battery every minutes at hd extreme graphics which is also good pro max would be far better in terms of battery for the software yes i feel like there are few downsides even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs it has two annoying things any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying clearing all notifications is also very annoying but other than that a perfect purchase i was very disappointed at myself when i paid for the iphone but when i received it i was truly happy that i bought it truly worth it the look is retrograde feel is cheap does not have physical double sim the airtel does not offer esim for prepaid connection fortunately jio revised an esim that got activated in hrs there is nothing so spectacular about the camera the cinematic mode is good this is my first exposure to iphone impression as good as any high end handset android is really more user friendly battery life for a new hand set is just good sustains hrs normal mixed use this product is duplicate of iphone only camera design changed very low quality of this product buy samsung mobile phone you should be a bigggggg bot to buy this phoneyou could get iphone pro that s the best there was a hairline scratch on the screen which is not clearly visible directly when we tried

am going to tag on the social media both amazon and apple such a big scam just but iphone it s not worth the money unless ur from bjp or something where you re full with corrupt money then go ahead i am poor and i cant afford it lmao xdxdxdxdxd so if you have money to flex buy it i am bored thats why i am writing this review while drinking coffee i have my chemistry exam on manday and cant study mole concept and got bored thats why i came here to write this review if you read this review til here very good you justt wasted your time now go and do something productive i do not have money that i can get a phone but i have a dream to get a phone which will definitely be fulfilled one day same as i phone who so ever is reading this review i suggest go for i phone apple marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone i have been on android for almost inception of phones and switching to iphone is just a pain no guide or help to transfer your critical data move to ios doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer if you want to buy go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there over hyped phone nothing great i have found in the phone may be i will find it better total stuck with ecosystem at k they don t provide charger and are selling the same as extra total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe i am not a happy customer till now in a world where we talk about openness and open for integration apple gives you a kind of black box boo to apple my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object i have been using android phones since the last years and finally decided to switch to iphone i used to roast iphone for its prices lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc but my last android phone iqoo legend had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android tired of bugs and software glitches in android i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it iphone is so smooth that even my iqoo legend with hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only hz and i can t believe what i m seeing all the games apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy w separate fast charger for rs but charging speed isn t disappointing display quality is truly flagship level and i m quite a fan of the small display believe it or not being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful build quality is great i would recommend not to waste extra k for buying pro because i don t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending k you can see in the rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone wide angle camera struggles in low light but main camera is really good captures true colours front camera is really good too truly flagship speakers are great battery life is better than my previous devices ios is very optimised in terms of battery life easy hrs sot on normal usage note while playing bgmi you loose around battery every minutes at hd extreme graphics which is also good pro max would be far better in terms of battery for the software yes i feel like there are few downsides even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs it has two annoying things any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying clearing all notifications is also very annoying but other than that a perfect purchase i was very disappointed at myself when i paid for the iphone but when i received it i was truly happy that i bought it truly worth it the look is retrograde feel is cheap does not have physical double sim the airtel does not offer esim for prepaid connection fortunately jio revised an esim that got activated in hrs there is nothing so spectacular about the camera the cinematic mode is good this is my first exposure to iphone impression as good as any high end handset android is really more user friendly battery life for a new hand set is just good sustains hrs normal mixed use this product is

strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe i am not a happy customer till now in a world where we talk about openness and open for integration apple gives you a kind of black box boo to apple my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object i have been using android phones since the last years and finally decided to switch to iphone i used to roast iphone for its prices lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc but my last android phone iqoo legend had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android tired of bugs and software glitches in android i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it iphone is so smooth that even my iqoo legend with hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only hz and i can t believe what i m seeing all the games apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy w separate fast charger for rs but charging speed isn t disappointing display quality is truly flagship level and i m quite a fan of the small display believe it or not being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful build quality is great i would recommend not to waste extra k for buying pro because i don t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending k
